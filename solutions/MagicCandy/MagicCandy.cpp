 In every iteration, floor(âˆšx) numbers are removed until `x` gets `1`.
 It's possible to compute how many steps are needed in O(âˆšN).
 I looked at the final state. If operation goes backward, below recurrence relation is obtained:
 
 x[0] = 1
 x[i] = x[i+1] - floor(âˆšx[i+1])
 
 f(x) = x - âˆšx is monotonically increasing function.
 It's possible to find x[i+1] by binary search in O(lg N).
 We can follow above recurrence relation in steps that we obtained in the first step.

 Very disappointing that I cannot solve now even though I solved by myself before.

 Data: # of candies
 Condition: Candy whose label is x^2 is removed and new labels are assigned until only one element remains
 Unknown: original label
 
 Find the connection between the data and the unknown
  => We can connect unknown to the data by keep finding original label in the previous state
 You may be obliged to consider auxiliary problems if an immediate connection cannot be found
  => Finding previous label before removal happens need to be solved. This is auxiliary problem
 Have you seen it before?
  => I have even solved this problem by myself
 Have you seen the same problem in a slightly diffferent form?
  => I have solved this problem by myself
 Do you know a related problem?
  => I have solved this problem by myself
 Look at the unknown! And try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown
 Could you restate the problem?
  => I should have restated to a problem to unwinding labels
 Go back to definitions
  => Definition of the operation is suggesting that next position can be found by x-sqrt(x)
 Could you solve a part of the problem? Keep only a part of the condition, drop the other part
  => This may not be necessary in this problem
 Could you derive something useful from the data?
  => I cannot in this problem
 Could you change the unknown or the data, or both if necessary, so that the new unknown and the new data are nearer to each other?
  => If I can find the label of previous state, I can be CLEARLY nearer to unknown
