<p><em>Single Round Match 660 Round 1 - Division II, Level Two</em></p>

<h2>Statement</h2>

<p>Hero is inviting his friends to the party.</p>

<p>He has n friends, numbered 0 through n-1.
For each of his friends there is at most one other person the friend dislikes.
You are given this information as a int[] <em>a</em> with n elements.
For each i, <em>a</em>[i] is either the number of the person disliked by friend i, we have <em>a</em>[i]=i if friend i likes everybody else.</p>

<p>Hero is inviting his friends one at a time.
Whenever he invites friend i, they will accept if and only if the friend <em>a</em>[i] didn't accept an earlier invitation.
(That includes two cases: either Hero didn't invite friend <em>a</em>[i] yet, or he did but the friend rejected the invitation.)</p>

<p>Hero noticed that the order in which he invites his friends matters: different orders may produce different numbers of accepted invitations.</p>

<p>Find an order that will produce the most accepted invitations, and return their number.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Class</em>: <code>PrivateD2party</code></li>
<li><em>Method</em>: <code>getsz</code></li>
<li><em>Parameters</em>: <code>int[]</code></li>
<li><em>Returns</em>: <code>int</code></li>
<li><em>Method signature</em>: <code>int getsz(int[] a)</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>Constraints</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>a</em> will contain exactly n elements.</li>
<li>n will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.</li>
<li>Each element of <em>a</em> will be between 0 and n - 1, inclusive.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>[0,1]</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>2</c></p>

<h4>Reason</h4>

<p>Each of the friends likes the other. Regardless of the order in which Hero asks them, they will both accept the invitation.</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>[1,0]</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>1</c></p>

<h4>Reason</h4>

<p>Friend 0 dislikes friend 1 and vice versa. The first friend Hero asks will accept the invitation but then the other friend will certainly reject it.</p>

<h3>Example 3</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>[1,0,3,2]</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>2</c></p>

<h3>Example 4</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>[5,2,2,4,5,0]</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>5</c></p>

<h4>Reason</h4>

<p>Here is what would happen if Hero invited the friends in the order (0,1,2,3,4,5):
Friend 5 didn't accept yet, so friend 0 would accept.
Friend 2 didn't accept yet, so friend 1 would accept.
Friend 2 likes everybody and therefore they would accept.
Friend 4 didn't accept yet, so friend 3 would accept.
Friend 5 didn't accept yet, so friend 4 would accept.
Friend 0 did already accept, therefore friend 5 would reject.
It turns out that this solution happens to be optimal: there is no order such that all six friends would accept the invitations.</p>

<h3>Example 5</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><c>[3,2,1,0,5,4]</c></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><c>3</c></p>
